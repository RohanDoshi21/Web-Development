            <p>
                Rubiks Cube classes were established in 2013 having taught more than 120 students in Pune, we are the Youngest and most Enthusiastic teachers that you will find near Kothrud.
                 Our training programs, for kids aged 6 yrs and above, are designed to help every student to improve his or her cognitive skills and grow into productive and competent individuals.  
                 Our reward and primary achievement has been the feedback from the parents on how our coaching programs have enhanced their kidsâ€™ academic and overall performance.
                 The vast experience has helped us understand the nuances of how the games influence the mental and cognitive development of children.
                 We have developed our training methods around the pivotal fact that the deeply analytical and logical nature of mind games like chess influences the foundational bricks of complex cognitive skills.
